# Autolayout
Manipulating Autolayout
Getting a feel for autoLayout. Had a username and password field, with 2 buttons.
One button to change password to secured password and back again. Other button was for login.
Once you logged in it gives you an image with a name and a company below the login. Used size
classes to make it so it would layout better on an iPhone and an ipad and not loose its look.
